## Convex Optimization

Description of files

Part 1:
StronglyConvex.m - optimizing a strongly convex quadratic function using following methods
- Steepest descent with fixed step
- Steepest descent with exact line search
- Heavy Ball
- Conjugate Gradient
- Hybrid - steepest descent fixed with heavy ball

Part 2:
xpowsing.m
- Powell's singular function - the following files in Part 2 minimize this function

hw6_nonlinearcg.m
- Main program which calls other functions

CG_FR.m
- Fletcher Reeves non-linear conjugate gradient algorithm

CG_PRplus.m
- Polak-Ribiere conjugate gradient method with slight modification

SteepDescent.m 
- Steepest descent

StepSize.m
- A one-dimensional search procedure that is guaranteed to find a step length satisfying the strong Wolfe conditions.
